# jzy3d-january-eclipse
The JZY3D graphical library (https://github.com/jzy3d) and the latest JOGL/Gluegen libraries have been bundled in OSGi-ready plugins and fragments. A test project (org.dawnsci.jzy3d.to.january) is available to preview a diffraction image loaded using Eclipse January (https://github.com/eclipse/january) as a surface in a JZY3d chart shown inside of an Eclipse 4 part component.

The target platform needed to successfully run this project includes the following dependencies:
* Running Eclipse 4 platform plugins
* Eclipse January (https://github.com/eclipse/january)
* Apache Log4j (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/log4j/log4j/1.2.17)
* Unit Of Measurement API (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.measure/unit-api/1.0)
* Apache Commons Maths3 (https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-math3/3.6.1)

Once the TP set, this repository and the Eclipse January one can be pulled and the project should compile and run.
